1. Setup (Bigger Context)
Industry Shift / Pain Spike
The healthcare administration and billing industry is experiencing a pivotal change. For years,
providers, insurers, and patients have endured inefficiencies from opaque billing, complex
requirements, and fragmented payor systems. Previous solutions couldn’t scale or adapt across all
payors.
Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence have changed what’s possible, enabling real-time
processing of complex data, proactive inefficiency detection, and automated integration. AI can
now deliver transparency, reduce errors, and streamline billing in ways manual or rules-based
approaches never could.
Organizations that fail to adopt AI-driven solutions risk falling behind—facing rising administrative
costs, persistent billing errors, and declining patient satisfaction. For those who act now, the
opportunity is to lead the shift toward agile, transparent, universally compatible billing systems.
What’s at Stake
Delaying AI adoption means continued manual reconciliations, unexpected claim denials, wasted
staff time, and missed revenue—while competitors surge ahead using new technology.
Teasing the Promise
What if your organization could automate eligibility checks, streamline reconciliations, and
drastically reduce denials—right away, without overhauling your systems?

Making the Old Way Unviable
Standard approaches can’t keep pace with growing complexity. Hours wasted on repetitive tasks,
costly manual errors, and inflexible software multiply pain as payor rules change.
Legacy methods simply cannot compete with AI-powered automation, real-time adaptation, and
single-source transparency.

Meta-Script for Sales Conversations
1. Setup (Bigger Context)
Thank you for taking the time to meet. Let me start by framing what’s happening in healthcare billing
right now. For years, providers and administrators have had to put up with slow, error-prone manual
reconciliations, confusing eligibility checks, and the challenge of connecting with multiple payors.
Previous solutions just haven’t scaled across the complexity of modern healthcare.
The big shift is that, for the first time, Artificial Intelligence can process and integrate billing data from all
these payor sources—automating what used to be impossible. Organizations that ignore this shift are
facing rising costs, more errors, and frustrated patients and staff. The gap between adopters and
laggards is growing by the month.
2. Confrontation (Breaking the Old Way)
Right now, most organizations rely on a mix of spreadsheets, payor-specific software, and outsourced
operations. These approaches force your best people to spend hours chasing issues and leave too
much room for mistakes, with high IT and integration costs.
No amount of patching or retraining can make that fundamentally broken approach competitive in
today’s environment.
3. Resolution (Demo the Better Way)
Now, here’s what’s different with our solution: - Our AI-powered billing platform unifies all your payor
data and automates eligibility, reconciliation, and claim reviews in real time. - Manual data entry, errorprone spreadsheets, and endless updates are eliminated, freeing your team for patient-focused work. -
The platform adapts as rules change, requiring no IT overhaul and fitting seamlessly with your existing
systems. - You stay ahead of billing issues with instant notifications and a single, transparent
dashboard.
You see results in days—not months—with minimal training required.

Does that sound like something you’d like to explore, or do you have any immediate questions about
how this would fit with your team?
Strong Delivery Tips:
Speak with conviction and clarity, pausing after each “act” to allow questions.
Maintain open body language (upright posture, open palms).
If interrupted with skepticism, acknowledge the concern and tie it back into the “old way” versus the
opportunity for transformation.
End confidently—invite a specific next action (“Would Tuesday or Thursday work best for a
detailed rollout discussion?”).
Examples of Strong vs. Weak Phrasing:
Strong: “For the first time, AI removes the biggest barriers in billing—automating, reconciling, and
adapting in real time.”
Weak: “We think AI could help make billing a bit better, maybe?”
Strong: “No manual entry, no patchwork software—just one intelligent system that adapts to every
payor, instantly.”
Weak: “It probably won’t be too hard to use.”
