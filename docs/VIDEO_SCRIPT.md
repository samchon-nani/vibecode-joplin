## ACT 2: CONFRONTATION (The Old Way) - 20-30 seconds

**[VISUAL: Can show examples of confusing bills or complex processes]**

## ACT 3: RESOLUTION (The Demo) - 2-3 minutes ⭐

### Introduction to BillHarmony

"BillHarmony is an AI-powered platform that brings clarity to care costs. Let me show you how it works..."

**[VISUAL: Show the app homepage]**

---

### 1. AI-Powered Search (30-45 seconds)

**[ACTION: Click on search box or show search form]**

"First, let's see how easy it is to search. No more complex forms—just describe what you need in plain English."

**[ACTION: Type in search box]**

"For example, I'll search for: 'I need an MRI with Blue Cross insurance in Beverly Hills, CA within 25 miles'"

**[ACTION: Submit search, show loading]**

"Watch how our AI understands the query—extracting the procedure, insurance, location, and distance automatically. No more filling out multiple fields or navigating complex forms."

**[VISUAL: Show search results appearing]**

---

### 2. Price Comparison Results (30-45 seconds)

**[ACTION: Point to results]**

"Here are the results—hospitals sorted by distance, with clear, transparent pricing for every option."

**[ACTION: Point to a specific hospital card]**

"Notice how each result clearly indicates whether it's an inpatient or outpatient procedure. You can see the visual indicator on each card—inpatient procedures require hospital admission and an overnight stay, while outpatient procedures are same-day with no overnight stay."

**[ACTION: Point to the classification badge]**

"This helps patients understand what to expect and plan not just financially, but also for their time."

**[ACTION: Show pricing details]**

"Each result shows in-network vs out-of-network status, and you can see the estimated cost with your insurance versus without insurance. The cost breakdown shows exactly what you'll pay—deductible, copay, and coinsurance."

**[ACTION: Show savings if applicable]**

"And you can see potential savings—in this case, you'd save [X amount] with insurance."

**[ACTION: Mention future feature]**

"Currently, we show the procedure classification. In the future, we're working on adding detailed cost breakdowns for inpatient stays, including room charges, medication costs, and extended care expenses, so patients have complete transparency into their total financial responsibility."

---

### 3. Financial Navigation Hub (30-45 seconds)

**[ACTION: Click on Financial Navigation Hub tab]**

"But BillHarmony is more than just price comparison. We've built a complete Financial Navigation Hub."

**[ACTION: Show the tabs]**

"You can see we have Price Comparison, Charity Eligibility, and Financial Assistance all in one place."

**[ACTION: Click on Charity Eligibility or show it]**

"For example, our Charity Eligibility feature helps patients find financial assistance programs. You can check eligibility based on household income, family size, and other factors—all powered by AI to match you with the right programs."

**[ACTION: Show how it works]**

"This proactive approach helps patients find help before they're overwhelmed by medical bills."

---

### 4. Key Features Highlights (30 seconds)

**[ACTION: Scroll or point to compliance badges]**

"BillHarmony is HIPAA and CMS compliant—ensuring patient data is protected and we meet all regulatory requirements."

**[ACTION: Point to key features]**

"We provide AI-powered transparency, real-time updates, and the platform instantly adapts as insurance rules change—no expensive IT overhauls needed."

---

## ACT 4: SUMMARY (Closing) - 20-30 seconds

**[VISUAL: Show app overview or return to homepage]**

"To summarize, BillHarmony is an AI-powered platform that brings clarity to healthcare costs. We solve the problem of opaque pricing and confusing medical bills by providing transparent, real-time price comparisons across hospitals."

**[ACTION: Point to key features]**

"Key features include: AI-powered natural language search that understands plain English queries, transparent price comparison with in-network and out-of-network options, inpatient and outpatient procedure classification, and a comprehensive Financial Navigation Hub that helps patients find charity care and financial assistance programs."

**[ACTION: Point to compliance badges]**

"All of this is built with HIPAA and CMS compliance in mind, ensuring patient data is protected and we meet healthcare regulatory requirements."

**[VISUAL: Show logo and tagline]**

"BillHarmony brings clarity to care costs—helping patients make informed decisions about their healthcare while reducing financial stress."

**[PAUSE - Show logo]**
