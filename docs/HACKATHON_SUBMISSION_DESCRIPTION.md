# BillHarmony - Hackathon Submission Description

## Project Name
**BillHarmony** - Bringing Clarity to Care Costs

## Problem Statement

Healthcare billing is broken. Patients face opaque pricing, confusing bills, and financial stress—while providers struggle with fragmented payor systems and manual processes. Current solutions rely on manual processes, payor-specific software, and fragmented systems that waste time, cause errors, and leave everyone in the dark.

## Solution Overview

BillHarmony is an AI-powered platform that brings clarity to healthcare costs by providing transparent, real-time price comparisons across hospitals. We solve the problem of opaque pricing and confusing medical bills by unifying billing data across all payor systems and delivering clear financial insights in real time.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Natural Language Search
- Users can search in plain English: "I need an MRI with Blue Cross insurance in Beverly Hills, CA within 25 miles"
- AI automatically extracts procedure, insurance, location, and distance
- No more complex forms or navigating multiple fields

### 2. Transparent Price Comparison
- Real-time price comparisons across hospitals
- Shows in-network vs out-of-network options
- Displays estimated costs with insurance vs without insurance
- Detailed cost breakdowns showing deductible, copay, and coinsurance
- Visual indicators for potential savings

### 3. Inpatient/Outpatient Classification
- Clear visual indicators showing whether procedures are inpatient or outpatient
- Helps patients understand what to expect and plan for time as well as cost
- Inpatient: Requires hospital admission/overnight stay
- Outpatient: Same-day procedures, no overnight stay

### 4. Financial Navigation Hub
- Comprehensive financial assistance tools in one place
- Charity Eligibility screening powered by AI
- Helps patients find financial assistance programs based on household income, family size, and other factors
- Proactive approach to finding help before patients are overwhelmed by medical bills

### 5. Compliance & Security
- HIPAA compliant - ensuring patient data is protected
- CMS compliant - meeting all healthcare regulatory requirements
- Built with security and privacy in mind

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **AI/ML**: Natural language processing for search queries
- **Data**: Hospital pricing data, insurance information, procedure classifications

## Impact

BillHarmony helps patients:

## Future Enhancements (If Time Permitted)

1. **AI Search for Daily Room Costs**: Users could search for daily room costs for inpatient care and get estimates based on typical length of stay
2. **Insurance Usage Tracking**: Option for users to input how much of their insurance they've already used this year (deductible, copays, coinsurance) to see actual out-of-pocket costs based on what they've already spent
