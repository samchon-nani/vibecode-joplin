## Script Template

Here's a template based on your Irresistible Offer document:

```
[INTRO - 30 seconds]
"Healthcare billing is broken. Patients face opaque pricing, confusing bills, 
and financial stress—while providers struggle with fragmented payor systems 
and manual processes. But AI is changing what's possible."

[PROBLEM - 20 seconds]
"Current solutions rely on manual processes, payor-specific software, and 
fragmented systems. These approaches waste time, cause errors, and leave 
everyone in the dark."

[DEMO - 2-3 minutes]
"BillHarmony is an AI-powered platform that brings clarity to care costs. 
Let me show you how it works..."

[Walk through features - see demo flow above]

[When showing Price Comparison Results:]
"Notice how each result clearly indicates whether it's an inpatient or outpatient procedure. You can see the visual indicator on each card—inpatient procedures require hospital admission and an overnight stay, while outpatient procedures are same-day with no overnight stay. This helps patients understand what to expect and plan not just financially, but also for their time. Currently, we show the procedure classification. In the future, we're working on adding detailed cost breakdowns for inpatient stays, including room charges, medication costs, and extended care expenses, so patients have complete transparency into their total financial responsibility."

[CLOSING - 20 seconds]
"We're launching a limited early-adopter program for healthcare organizations 
ready to lead with AI. 50% off for the first 6 months, with full access to
